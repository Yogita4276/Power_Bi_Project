# 💳 Credit Card Customer Insights Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze customer demographics and credit card transaction data. It reveals key patterns in customer behavior, revenue generation, and card usage across different segments.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Credit card companies need to understand **who their customers are**, **how they spend**, and **which products are profitable**. This dashboard turns raw transactional and demographic data into business intelligence to support strategic decisions.

The goal is to build an end-to-end dashboard that:
- Combines customer and transaction data
- Analyzes trends and patterns
- Provides actionable insights for stakeholders

## 🗂 Data Sources

Two primary data sources were used:
1. **Customer Table**  
   - Age Group  
   - Gender  
   - Education Level  
   - Income Category  
   - Marital Status  
   - Personal Loan Ownership  

2. **Transaction Table**  
   - Card Category  
   - Total Transaction Amount  
   - Revenue  
   - Interest Earned

These tables were cleaned and loaded into Power BI, with relationships built based on a unique customer identifier.
